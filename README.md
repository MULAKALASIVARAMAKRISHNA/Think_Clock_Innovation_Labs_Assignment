Battery Aging Analysis and Visualization ðŸš€ Overview This project analyzes the aging of Li-ion batteries by visualizing key parameters such as:

Battery Impedance Electrolyte Resistance (Re) Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) The analysis uses NASA's Battery Dataset, collected through charge/discharge cycles and impedance measurements.

Features Data Preprocessing: Cleans and processes the data, handling missing values via interpolation. Battery Impedance Calculation: Combines Re and Rct to calculate overall battery impedance. Interactive Visualizations: Battery Impedance vs. Cycle Electrolyte Resistance (Re) vs. Cycle Charge Transfer Resistance (Rct) vs. Cycle All plots are created using Plotly for interactivity.

Setup Instructions Clone the Repository:

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/MULAKALASIVARAMAKRISHNA/Think-Clock-Innovation-Labs-Assignment.git

cd Think-Clock-Innovation-Labs-Assignment

Install Dependencies:

Ensure Python 3.x is installed, then run:

bash Copy code pip install pandas plotly Prepare the Dataset: Download the NASA Battery Dataset and place the metadata.csv file in a data/ folder within the project directory. Update the file path in the script:

python Copy code file_path = "data/metadata.csv" Run the Script: Execute the Python script to generate visualizations:

bash Copy code python battery_analysis.py Project Output Battery Impedance vs. Cycle Re (Electrolyte Resistance) vs. Cycle Rct (Charge Transfer Resistance) vs. Cycle Visualizations provide insights into how battery parameters change with aging.
